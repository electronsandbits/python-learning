"""
The following program compares each number in a list to see if it is
greater than, less than, or equal to a test number.
If either of the first two comparisons are successful, all the
following comparisons donâ€™t need to be carried out, so the
computer can jump immediately back to the beginning of the
loop and move onto checking the next number in the list.
