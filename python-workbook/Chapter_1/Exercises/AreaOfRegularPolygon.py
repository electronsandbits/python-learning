"""
A polygon is regular if its sides are all the same length and the angles between all of
the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be computed using
the following formula, where s is the length of a side and n is the number of sides:

                                  area = (n × s2) / (4 × tan (π/n))
Write a program that reads s and n from the user and then displays the area of a
regular polygon constructed from these values.
