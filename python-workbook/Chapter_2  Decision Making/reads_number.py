--------------------
The following program reads a number from the user, uses two if statements to
store a message describing the number into the result variable, and then displays
the message.

"""
# Read a number from the user
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Store the appropriate message in result
if number == 0:
    result = "The number was zero"
if number !=:
    result = "The number was not zero"

# Display the message
print(result)
