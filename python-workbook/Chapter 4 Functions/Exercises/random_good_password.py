""""
Using your solutions to Exercises 100 and 102, write a program that generates a
random good password and displays it. Count and display the number of attempts
that were needed before a good password was generated. Structure your solution so
that it imports the functions you wrote previously and then calls them from a function
named main in the file that you create for this exercise.
